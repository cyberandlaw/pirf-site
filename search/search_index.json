The inspiration for this project stems from lessons learned in industry to unofficial ad hoc guides we've developed for our family and friends after they experience a breach or when they ask for cybersecurity related help. </p> <p>Think of this resource as a well-organized compilation of tips from the cybersecurity experts at Cyber and Law in an approachable format regardless of technical skill level. </p> <p>The core phases for the PIRF are: 1.Prevention,  2. Detection, and  3. Remediation. The PIRF matrix below shows a high-level view of actions you can take to prevent, detect, or remediate specific cybersecurity incidents:</p> Action/Event Prevent Detect Remediate Clicked suspicious link Learn to spot phishing Unexpected logins, anti-virus alerts Change passwords, scan system Reused passwords Use password manager Breach alerts, login anomalies Update passwords, enable MFA Lost/stolen device Enable encryption, remote wipe New logins from device Wipe device, reset passwords Opened shady attachment Don\u2019t open unknown files System slowdown, anti-virus warnings Disconnect, scan, restore backup Used public Wi-Fi Use VPN Strange session activity Log out, change passwords Fake tech support interaction Don\u2019t trust unsolicited support Remote tool running, missing funds Remove access, contact bank Overshared online Limit personal info shared Targeted scams or phishing Remove posts, monitor identity theft Skipped software updates Enable auto-updates anti-virus picks up exploits Patch, check system No MFA Enable MFA everywhere Login notifications, password resets Turn on MFA, reset password Plugged unknown USB Don\u2019t use untrusted devices Device acts oddly Scan or wipe device Fell victim to gift card scam Learn about gift card scams Unexpected contact from \"IT\" Stop contact, report the scam <p>Each page in PIRF is designed to be standalone.
