## Introduction
### What is PIRF?

PIRF stands for the Personal Incident Response Framework. It’s a public knowledge base for dealing with personal cyber incidents — from “I lost my wallet” to “Grandma clicked a weird link.” Use it yourself, or point your friends and family to this link when they need step-by-setup instructions.

The advice contained herein borrows from current enterprise indicident response techniques and simplifies them for everyday users. The core phases in any incident response plan are:

1. [Prevention](framework/prevention/prevention.md)  
2. [Detection](framework/detection/detection.md)  
3. [Remediation](framework/remediation/remediation.md)

## FAQs

### What are PIRF Personas?

### How is this different from Privacy Guides?
- [Privacy Guides](https://www.privacyguides.org) is fantastic and everyone should use it.
- PIRF is focused on **what to do during a crisis**, offering simple step-by-step remediation and makes incident response accessible to an audience beyond cybersecurity professionals and technically inclined individuals.

### Why not just Google or use ChatGPT?
- PIRF is developed by experts in the field. While you can certainly find fantastic information through your own research sometimes time does not permit. Furthermore, sometimes GAI responses can be factually inaccurate or incomplete. On PIRF you can be sure that the information considers an incident from multiple angles.

### Can I share PIRF?
- Absolutely. In fact, it's encourage. PIRF is built to empower **anyone**. Print it, use it for employee training, hang it in your office...go wild!
