# Remediation
> The final step in the PIRF Framework is Remediation. Learn how to respond when something goes wrong, recover from incidents, and build resilience for the future.
## Overview 
This section provides step-by-step response strategies for common cybersecurity incidents affecting individuals and families. The aim is to give non-experts the knowledge and tools they need to take back control during a digital crisis.

Remediation is about fixing what’s broken, containing damage, and restoring your digital life. 

Every incident is different, but the core response steps are often the same.
## The Individual Incident Response Process
While professionals use structured playbooks, individuals can follow a simplified five-step process.
### 1. Acknowledge the Situation
Before taking action, you need to understand what happened. Refer back to the detection step to determine:

- What’s been compromised? (Email? Device? Bank account?)
- How did you notice? (Alert? Suspicious login? Strange messages?)
- What could the attacker access from here?
- Was it a one-time incident or part of a larger breach?
### 2. Contain the Damage
Limit the attacker’s access as quickly as possible.

- Change passwords immediately, starting with your email
- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on affected accounts
- Log out of all devices (most services let you do this remotely)
- Disconnect infected devices from the internet
- Revoke access for unknown third-party apps or browser extensions
- Freeze credit, if personal financial data is involved
### 3. Repair and Restore
Start cleaning up and regaining control.

- Run malware/virus scans on all affected devices
- Remove suspicious apps, browser extensions, or programs
- Contact your provider (email, phone, bank, social media) for account recovery
- Report fraudulent activity to banks and reverse unauthorized transactions
- File reports with platforms, email providers, or app stores as needed
- Reset security questions or backup methods for all critical accounts
### 4. Notify and Report
You may need to inform others or report the incident formally.

- Warn contacts if the attack spread through DMs or emails
- Report to:
    - FTC (for fraud and identity theft)
    - Local law enforcement (especially if stalking, sextortion, or threats are involved)
    - Credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax, TransUnion)
    - State Attorney General (for broader consumer protection)
- Use platform-specific reporting tools (e.g., for impersonation or harassment)
### 5. Reflect and Fortify
After recovery, take time to analyze how the incident happened and how to prevent recurrence.

- What vulnerability was exploited?
- Were you using weak/reused passwords?
- Was 2FA disabled?
- Did you fall for a phishing message or click something suspicious?

Use what you learn to:

- Update your threat model
- Adjust your privacy settings
- Strengthen your overall prevention posture using the PIRF framework
## Common Scenarios + Response Tips
Here’s a quick-reference guide to specific types of incidents with links to detailed playbooks (coming soon):

| **Scenario**                       | **Immediate Steps**                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hacked Email Account**           | Change password, check recovery options, scan sent/forwarded messages, alert contacts          |
| **Stolen or Lost Phone**           | Use device locator to lock/erase remotely, change app passwords, contact carrier               |
| **Social Media Hijack**            | Use account recovery tools, report to platform, alert followers, enable 2FA                    |
| **Bank Fraud/Unauthorized Charge** | Contact bank to freeze account, file fraud report, monitor credit                              |
| **Doxxing or Harassment**          | Document evidence, report to platforms, increase privacy settings, consider law enforcement    |
| **Malware/Ransomware Infection**   | Disconnect device, run antivirus/malware scanner, back up data, consider professional help     |
| **Phishing or Scam Victim**        | Identify what was accessed, change passwords, monitor accounts, report to relevant authorities |

## Emotional Recovery is Part of the Process
Digital incidents can feel deeply personal, stressful, and violating. That’s normal. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed—and it’s okay to ask for help.

Consider:

- Talking to someone about the experience
- Taking breaks from tech while things settle
- Using the incident as motivation to build better digital habits
## What’s Next?
Make sure you take time to learn from what happened, update your protections, and consider sharing what you’ve learned to help others.
