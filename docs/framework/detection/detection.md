# Detection

> The second step in the PIRF Framework is Detection. Learn how to recognize when something’s gone wrong so you can act quickly.
## Overview
In professional environments, cybersecurity detection involves complex systems—think security operation centers, automated alerts, and teams of analysts combing through logs.

But for individuals, detection looks different. It’s about knowing what warning signs to look for, staying alert to changes in your digital environment, and using available tools to spot trouble early.

Early detection can be the difference between a quick fix and a long-term nightmare.
## What Does Detection Look Like for Individuals?
Here are common detection scenarios for everyday users:

- Noticing a suspicious login on your account
- Receiving an email or text about an account change you didn’t make
- Seeing new devices connected to your cloud storage or streaming accounts
- Your phone slowing down, heating up, or showing strange behavior
- Friends reporting weird messages from your social media
- Getting a security alert from your browser, antivirus, or operating system
- Finding unauthorized charges on your financial accounts
- Emails showing as read or sent—when you didn’t open or send them
## Key Signs of a Possible Compromise
Here are some warning signs by category to help you detect incidents:
### Account-Based Warning Signs
- Passwords no longer work
- Recovery info (email or phone number) was changed
- You’re locked out of your account
- You receive login attempt alerts from unknown locations or devices
- Suspicious apps or third-party logins appear in your account settings
### Device-Based Warning Signs

- Device is overheating or lagging for no clear reason
- Apps you didn’t install are present
- Battery drains unusually fast
- Webcam/mic activates without your knowledge
- Pop-ups or redirects in your browser
- Antivirus or security features disabled
### Social Signs
- Contacts report weird DMs, posts, or emails from you
- You’re suddenly following or liking accounts you don’t recognize
- Your phone number or name is being used by a fake account
### Financial Warning Signs
- Unexpected charges on bank or credit card statements
- Emails about purchases or subscriptions you didn’t make
- Credit report shows new accounts you didn’t open
- Notifications of failed login attempts on financial apps
## Tools for Personal Detection
You don’t need to be a security expert to monitor your own risk. Here are tools and habits that help:

| **Tool / Habit**                           | **What It Does**                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Account Activity Logs**                  | View sign-ins, IPs, device types (Google, Apple, Microsoft, etc.)     |
| **Login Alerts**                           | Get notified about new device logins or failed attempts               |
| **Credit Monitoring**                      | Detect unauthorized financial activity (Experian, Credit Karma, etc.) |
| **Antivirus or Endpoint Software**         | Warns you of malware, ransomware, or unusual app behavior             |
| **Google Takeout / Facebook Activity Log** | Let you review unexpected actions taken under your account            |
| **Phishing Simulators or Training**        | Helps train your eye to spot fraudulent messages                      |
| **Dark Web Monitoring Tools**              | Alerts you if your credentials are found in a breach database         |

## What If You Think Something’s Wrong?
If something looks off—even if you’re not 100% sure—**trust your instincts**. It’s better to investigate early than wait until damage is done.

Ask yourself:

- Did I authorize that activity?
- Is this behavior normal for my device or account?
- Was I expecting this message or notification?
- Do I recognize that login location or IP address?

If you experience any of these it's time to do remediation.
