### When Charges are Blocked by Credit Card Security

    - Contact your credit card issuer **using the number on the back of your credit card** to confirm which charges were blocked.

    - The card provider will help you determine if the blocked transactions were legitimate or fraudulent.
1. **Update Security Measures**

	- Enabling 2FA/MFA every time you sign into your account instructions based on your institution are below:
		- American Express
		- Bank of America
		- Capital One
		- Chase
		- Citi Bank
		- Discover
		- US Bank
		- Wells Fargo


    - Ensure that your contact information is up-to-date with your issuer to receive alerts and notifications.
    - Consider setting up transaction alerts for added security.
5. **Review and Monitor**
    
    - Regularly review your account statements for any unauthorized activity.
    - Monitor your credit report to detect any signs of identity theft.
6. **Educate Yourself**
    
    - Stay informed about common fraud schemes and how to protect your financial information.
    - Implement best practices for online and offline security to minimize the risk of future fraud.
