# Overview
## Incident Response
PIRF is a personal incident response framework tailored specifically for individuals. In cybersecurity, an incident response framework refers to a structured approach for monitoring, detecting, and responding to security events. PIRF extends this concept to include proactive, preventative measures designed for everyday users.

While PIRF simplifies the steps found in traditional organizational incident response models, it preserves the essential components needed to address individual-scale cybersecurity threats.

The PIRF Framework consists of three core phases:

1. [**Prevention**](/framework/prevention/prevention/) — Focuses on identifying your personal risks and implementing strategies to reduce the likelihood of a cybersecurity incident before it occurs.
2. [**Detection**](/framework/detection/detection/) — Covers how to recognize when something has gone wrong—whether it’s unauthorized access, unusual activity, or signs of compromise—so you can act quickly.
3. [**Remediation**](/framework/remediation/remediation/) — Guides you through taking corrective action, recovering from incidents, and preventing recurrence.

## PIRF Matrix
The PIRF Matrix below shows how the three phases can be used to assess common actions/events and create a stepwise plan for yourself or loved ones.

| Action/Event                         | Resulting Incident(s)                        | Prevent                                                       | Detect                                                          | Remediate                                                   |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Clicked on a phishing link**       | Identity theft, malware, account compromise  | Learn to spot phishing; use email filtering and link scanners | Monitor for strange logins, antivirus alerts                    | Change passwords, run malware scan, freeze credit if needed |
| **Reused passwords across sites**    | Credential stuffing, account takeover        | Use a password manager with strong, unique passwords          | Watch for breach alerts (e.g., HaveIBeenPwned), login anomalies | Change passwords, enable MFA, check linked accounts         |
| **Lost/stolen phone or laptop**      | Device compromise, data loss, identity theft | Enable full-disk encryption and remote wipe                   | Unusual logins or access to accounts from the device            | Remotely wipe, change credentials, report to authorities    |
| **Downloaded suspicious attachment** | Malware infection, ransomware                | Don’t open unknown files; use email scanning                  | Sluggish system, popup messages, AV alerts                      | Isolate device, run antivirus, restore from backup          |
| **Used unsecured public Wi-Fi**      | Session hijacking, data interception         | Use a VPN and avoid sensitive activity on public Wi-Fi        | Unexpected logins or session expirations                        | Change passwords, log out of all sessions                   |
| **Responded to fake tech support**   | Remote access malware, financial fraud       | Know legit support won’t reach out unsolicited                | Remote access tools running, unexplained bank activity          | Disconnect, uninstall tools, contact bank/support           |
| **Shared personal info publicly**    | Identity theft, targeted scams               | Limit personal data online; use privacy settings              | Phishing or scam messages referencing shared info               | Delete exposed posts, monitor identity/fraud reports        |
| **Ignored software updates**         | Malware via unpatched vulnerabilities        | Enable auto-updates, use supported software                   | Exploits detected by antivirus or endpoint monitoring           | Patch immediately, check for compromise                     |
| **Didn’t enable MFA**                | Account compromise from leaked credentials   | Turn on MFA wherever available                                | Unexpected login alerts, password reset notifications           | Enable MFA, review access logs, change password             |
| **Plugged in unknown USB device**    | Malware, keylogger installation              | Avoid unknown devices; disable autorun                        | New processes or strange behavior after insertion               | Scan with AV, consider system wipe if critical              |
