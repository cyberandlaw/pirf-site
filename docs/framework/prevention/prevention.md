# Prevention

> The first step in the PIRF Framework is Prevention. Learn how to decide what you want to protect yourself from with a threat model.
## Overview
This section provides comprehensive guidance on proactive strategies to enhance your personal cybersecurity posture. By understanding what you need to protect and taking steps to reduce your risk, you can avoid or minimize the impact of most digital incidents.

A major component of prevention is minimizing your attack surface[^1] and addressing your vulnerabilities[^2]. That begins with knowing your risks.
# Understanding Personal Risk
The first step in prevention is understanding what you’re trying to protect—and from whom. This means identifying the devices, accounts, and data that matter to you, as well as who might want to access or damage them. This is where threat modeling comes in.
## Threat Modeling
Threat modeling may sound technical, but it’s essentially a structured way to answer three questions:

1. What do I have that’s worth protecting?
2. Who might try to access or harm it?
3. How would they try to do it?

Once you understand your risks, you can better decide what tools or strategies make sense for your situation. Not everyone needs the same level of protection, and that’s okay.
## What is a Threat Model?
A threat model is a personalized security plan that helps you think critically about:

- **Assets**: The things you want to protect (e.g., photos, email, location, financial accounts).
- **Adversaries**: Who might be interested in compromising those assets (e.g., scammers, exes, stalkers, corporate trackers, nation-states).
- **Attack vectors**: How those adversaries might gain access (e.g., phishing emails, weak passwords, stolen devices, surveillance apps). 
## Do I Need a Threat Model?
Yes—but it doesn’t need to be formal or complex. Even asking yourself, _“What would happen if someone hacked into my email?”_ is a basic form of threat modeling.

Here’s when it’s especially helpful:

- You’ve experienced a security incident before.
- You work in sensitive fields (journalism, law, activism).
- You’re concerned about harassment, stalking, or surveillance.
- You handle other people’s sensitive information.
- You just want to be more intentional about your online safety.
## Designing Your Threat Model
Here’s a quick way to build a simple personal threat model:

| **Step**                    | **Question**                                   | **Examples**                                       |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Identify Assets**      | What do I want to protect?                     | Email, photos, location, bank info, health data    |
| **2. Identify Adversaries** | Who might want to access or harm these things? | Random hackers, data brokers, abusive ex, employer |
| **3. Analyze Risks**        | How might they attack?                         | Phishing, malware, password reuse, device theft    |
| **4. Prioritize**           | What’s most likely or most damaging?           | Email account access, social media impersonation   |
| **5. Defend**               | What can I do to reduce risk?                  | Use 2FA, secure backups, hide location metadata    |

## PIRF Profiles
To help you match prevention tactics to your level of risk, the PIRF framework provides multiple profiles. They provide general threat models based on inferences in various occupations. They will not match anyone's situation to a tee—they’re meant to help guide your choices. You can find the profiles [here](/pirf-profiles).
## What’s Next?
Once you’ve thought through what you’re protecting and implemented preventative strategies, the next step is being able to recognize when something’s gone wrong.

[^1]: _Attack surface_ refers to how “open” you are to an attack. The smaller your attack surface, the less likely you are to be targeted or compromised.
[^2]: _Vulnerabilities_ are areas where your security is weak or incomplete. For example, using the same password across accounts is a common vulnerability.
