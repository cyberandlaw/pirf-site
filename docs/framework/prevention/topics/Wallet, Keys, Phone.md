## Wallet
1. Do not carry your social security card
2. Do not carry a debit card
3. Consider an AirTag tracker
4. Try and minimize the number of credit card you have on your person
5. Always opt for forms of payment that provide more security over physical credit cards and checks:
	1. Cash - Fixed amount that can be stolen, increased privacy
	2. Apple Wallet - Rotating card numbers and security PINs
		1. Consider an Apple Card
			2. 2% cash back on most purchases when using Apple Pay
			3. 1% back when you use the physical card BUT the physical card does not have any numbers which is a significant privacy and security improvement over traditional credit cards. The only information it has is your name.
	3. Samsung Wallet
	4. Google Wallet
6. Take a photo over everything in your wallet for peace of mind
7. Freeze your credit at the 3 major credit bureaus and 2 minor ones

## Keys
1. Don't have anything with your address attached to your keys, seems straightforward but many wallets can carry keys and sometimes people have return tags
2. Consider purchasing and affixing an AirTag or similar tracking tag
3. Lay out your keys on the table and take a picture of all of them, this will help you get the keys replaced in the event that your loose them and don't want new locks or don't remember which keys you had (locksmiths can cut keys from photographs (don't post pictures of your keys!))
## Phone
1. Use FaceID when in public (see article about people stealing and unlocking phones)
2. Turn on "theft mode" if you have an iPhone
3. Enable FindMy if you have an iPhone
4. Ensure you have a password with at least 6 numbers on the iPhone 
	1. If you want you can opt for a text password that you would only enter when your FaceID doesn't work or after your phone restarts
